This is a Node.JS project that i use to understand Node.JS deeply.
By time this will cover the basic Node.JS operations, DB connection, Authentication, Error handling to Rest & GraphQL API, Websockets, Email Management..etc

The code follows a slighlt older syntax beacuse right now i'm building this with the help of tutorial and i will try to update it once i complete the majority of the project

If you plan to use this code run `npm install` before using.

If you have a MongoDB cluster set the URL in `.env` file with the key name `MONGODB_URL`
